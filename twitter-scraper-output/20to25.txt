Much of this is on COVID. So many players opted out &amp;/or left the team. Mason left w a crippled, depleted roster.  Zebos did nothing to help.  Lea inherited a jr college roster &amp; impossible situation to get 4 &amp; 5 Star recruits.  This will take time &amp; recruits. #college
Heck yes Julie! Gah. And even at the uni/college level, I think it would change the mentality to have yearly minimum pedagogy credit hours for teaching professors as part of tenure, just like K-12 teachers. I mean…many do the equivalent already but the rewards are slim. #college
